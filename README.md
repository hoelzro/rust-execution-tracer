# Rust Execution Tracer

A dummy program I wrote to play with Rust 0.6.  It has since been updated for each
release of Rust, resulting in some (probably) pretty gnarly code.

This program plays with Rust's FFI to print the exec() tree of a program, so you can
track which helper programs another program is using.
